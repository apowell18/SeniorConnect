# SeniorConnect

## Inspiration
I wanted to do a project based on social issues within my community. Where I live, we have a large 65+ community and I wondered how the senior population may have been impacted by the pandemic. During 2020 Valentine's Day, I had volunteered with American Red Cross to give out valentine's cards to veteran patients.  Remembering how happy the older veterans were when receiving the gifts, it pushed me to create this project. The original idea of the project was a platform advocating to send letters to seniors in hospice care and/or living assistance, however, I had branched the idea to create a safe space for the 65+ community to build more connections. Users can either send messages or send letters. Essentially creating a pen pal platform for the older population.

## What it does 
Senior Connect is a web-application prototype that creates a safe space for the 65+ community. Senior citizens would have the opportunity to send and/or receive letters and digital messages. People not in the community could create an account as a writer and send letters to either organizations or to a senior citizen. Organizations that cares for seniors could create/manage accounts for their population as well. 

## How we built it
The logo for Senior Connect was inspired by the quill pen and Hermes' halo. For the logo, I had sketched it and then transferred the image to Pixlr in order to create a digital image. Pixlr is inexpensive alternative to photoshop. The prototype was created in Figma. Assets such as the navigation bar, divider, and profile preview was created in Figma. 

## Challenges we ran into
I didn't  have a lot of experience with UI/UX design, so this was my first time creating a prototype and handling UX/UI Design. I had to make sure that the website would be accessible for senior citizens, since they are the main audience. In the future, I would like to improve the color palatte and user interface. 

## What I learned
In the future, I would invest in a digital editor such as Photoshop. I learned new skills in UX/UI design and handling Figma. I was able to create variants of the similar assets and reuse the same component. Since this project was conducted over the course of 48 hours, there will need to be proper research and execution of the subject.
